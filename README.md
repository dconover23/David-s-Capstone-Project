It will essentially be some sort of whacko weather station; using a weather sensor (connecting to an external weather API of some sort) it will report the following info:

Temp on either a seven-segment display or LCD screen.

A button that cycles through a few locations (maybe locations in Colorado). Ideally I'd love to use a tiny screen that has a little tkinter application to do this, but we'll have to see.

A motor that spins faster or slower depending on wind speed. 0 is no wind, 0.5 is some wind, 1 is harsh wind. Will probably have to have some sort of off button so it doesn't get annoying.

A multicolor LED that changes based on temp. Blue is cold, yellow is warm, red is hot.
