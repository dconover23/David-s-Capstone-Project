1. I have begun construction on the display itself (LCD screen hooked up to Pi) and the desktop application that will return the weather information.
2. Yes. I have the display itself (thank you for finding that!) and all the other parts I'll need are in the lab.
3. 3. A stretch goal would be to have a case that the display sits in, preferrably 3D printed. I'm not sure when I will begin manufacturing that, but it will likely come sometime after everything is hooked up and planned. I was planning on using a cardboard box, but that sounds pretty awful for ventilation.
4. Yes. I have elements on the project that correspond to all functional element categories.
5.
  1. The actual weather app the Pi will run itself.
  2. The casing for the display.
  3. Getting it all done on time. There's so much yet to do!
